//! Synchronization primitives over shared memory.
//!
//! This module provides an alternative implementation for the `ngx_atomic_t` type,
//! `ngx_atomic_*`/`ngx_rwlock_*` family of functions and related usage patterns from nginx.
//!
//! `<ngx_atomic.h>` contains a wide variety of implementation variants for different platforms and
//! build configurations. It's not feasible to properly expose all of these to the Rust code, and we
//! are not going to. The implementation here uses similar logic on the foundation of the
//! [core::sync::atomic] types and is intentionally _not interoperable_ with the nginx atomics.
//! Thus, it's only suitable for use for new shared memory structures instead of, for example,
//! interacting with the upstream zones.
//!
//! One potential pitfall here is that atomics in Rust are specified in terms of threads, and we use
//! the types in this module for interprocess synchronization. This should not be an issue though,
//! as Rust refers to the C/C++11 memory model for atomics, and there's a following note in
//! [atomics.lockfree]:
//!
//! > [Note: Operations that are lock-free should also be address-free. That is, atomic operations
//! > on the same memory location via two different addresses will communicate atomically. The
//! > implementation should not depend on any per-process state. This restriction enables
//! > communication via memory that is mapped into a process more than once and by memory that is
//! > shared between two processes. â€” end note]
//!
//! In practice, this recommendation is applied in all the implementations that matter to us.
